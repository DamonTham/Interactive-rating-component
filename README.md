  <div class="thankyou-rating">
    <div>You selected <span class="selected-rating"></span> out of 5</div>
  </div>
  <h1 class="thankyou-heading">Thank you!</h1>
  <p class="thankyou-text">
    We appreciate you taking the time to give a rating. If you ever need more
    support, donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch!

```css
.rating-content {
  background-color: hsl(212, 19%, 15%);
  margin: 0 20px;
  padding: 30px;
  color: #fff;
  border-radius: 25px;
  display: flex;
